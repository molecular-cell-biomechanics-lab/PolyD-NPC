bd_v3.4/ffs

log:
03/06/2023
minor: 	added temp check

02/07/2023
minor: 	rcar as a real number input

11/18/2022
minor:	return value when simulation terminated is 2
		added continue action in the jobscript
		crated a new file cont.sh

10/29/2022
MAJOR: changed sim/src/cargo.cpp and sim/src/bead.cpp so that constructors do not invoke init_rand()
	   this is because every time we generate _pos, random number generater gets initialized
	   even if the _cargo and _fgnup object generated there are different from the simulated ones
	   (SHOULD BE CORRECTED in bd_v3.3)

10/27/2022
MAJOR: changed _pos class to include simply _cargo and _fgnup
	   this was implemented since there is no need to save working memory any more
	   and we missed saving the interaction "state" in the previous version 
	   (SHOULD BE CORRECTED in bd_v3.3)

10/26/2022
took over from bd_v3.3
minor: sim.cpp/log_output() - added state count
minor: divs.txt, kbra.txt, pend.txt changed

07/23/2022
modified sim.cpp/choose_next() to consider the pruning weight when choosing the next
modieied sim.cpp/write_rate()  to correctly align the prob and w_ib

07/27/2022
modified sim.cpp/pruning()     to change pruning probability based on relative position
modified sim.cpp/launch_ksim() to free memory of failed trials -- temp_traj_k.pos.shrink_to_fit()

07/29/2022
modified sim.h/_pos()  		   to store frc as float
this is to save space of temp_traj
accordingly, changed sim.cpp/convert functions

08/09/2022
modified sim.cpp/write_rate() to add step number in rate.txt
modified sim.cpp/write_path() to output the last step of VTK
added 	 sim.cpp/log_output()

08/29/2022
modified sim.cpp/log_output() for free energy analysis

09/06/2022
transplanted from bd_v3
added main.cpp/check_input()

09/08/2022
use ssd to store trajectory
changed rate.txt output
added cxn.cpp to connect trajectory
added cpos output

09/23/2022
finish simulation in the middle

09/27/2022
added debug mode -> sim.h, param.cpp
added bond number to pt_*** output
