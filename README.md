# PolyD-NPC  
Brownian dynamics simulation of molecular transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC).

This repository contains the simulation code used in the study:  
**"Role of pore dilation in molecular transport through the nuclear pore complex: insights from polymer scaling theory"**  
by **Atsushi Matsuda** and **Mohammad R. K. Mofrad**.  

## **Simulation Code**
- The **main simulation code** is located in:  
```markdown
prog/sim
```

Please refer to the README in this directory for instructions on how to **compile and run the code**.

## **Advanced Methods**
The study implements advanced computational methods located in the following directories:

- **First flux calculation**:  
```markdown
prog/method/basin
```

- **Forward flux sampling (FFS)**:  
```markdown
prog/method/ffs
```
Each method has its own **README** file with detailed usage instructions.
